# Password Generator

## Description
This project is a password generator that creates random, secure passwords based on specific criteria such as length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters(symbols)).

## Features
- User can choose the password length.
- The program allows the user to select whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the password.
- Generates random, strong passwords that are difficult to guess.

## How it Works
- The program starts by asking the user to specify the password length (e.g., 1-32 characters).
- The user is prompted to choose if they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Based on the selected criteria, the program generates a random password by randomly picking characters from the available sets (e.g., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers).
- The generated password is displayed as the output.
